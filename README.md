# TweeVoorTwaalf

I was watching a twee voor twaalf episode and thought it would be nice
if I had a word helper, so this is it.

Haven't checked if all words exist and probably the list of words isn't exhaustive.

## Usage
Enter the known letters into the input, the order does not matter.
If you already know the position of letters, you can add a comma (,)
after the known letters and put in 12 positions. 

Positions for which you don't know a letter yet, you need to fill in a dot (.)

For example: alspveld,v..s.pe.....

The known letters are `alspveld` and the positions are `v..s.pe.....`.
This combination will give you the word "valsspeelden" ðŸ˜‰

## Is it any good?
